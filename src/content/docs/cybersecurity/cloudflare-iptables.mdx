# Securing NGINX with Cloudflare and IPTables

When it comes to securing an NGINX web server, using Cloudflare in conjunction with IPTables offers an added layer of security. Cloudflare acts as a reverse proxy, offering benefits like DDoS protection and reduced latency, while IPTables is a powerful tool for traffic filtering. Together, they can greatly enhance the security of your server.

## Why Use Cloudflare with IPTables?

**Cloudflare** not only provides protection against DDoS attacks but also hides your server's real IP address, making it less vulnerable. By using **IPTables**, you set up a rule that allows traffic only from Cloudflare's IP addresses, thereby preventing unwanted traffic.

## How to Set It Up?

### Step 1: Block All HTTP/HTTPS Traffic

Start by blocking all incoming traffic on HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443) ports:

```bash
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport http -j DROP
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport https -j DROP
```

These commands block direct traffic to your server on the standard web ports.

### Step 2: Allow Traffic from Cloudflare's IP Addresses

Next, allow traffic only from Cloudflare's IP addresses. Use the following commands to permit HTTP and HTTPS traffic:

```bash
for i in `curl https://www.cloudflare.com/ips-v4`; do iptables -I INPUT -p tcp -s $i --dport http -j ACCEPT; done
for i in `curl https://www.cloudflare.com/ips-v4`; do iptables -I INPUT -p tcp -s $i --dport https -j ACCEPT; done
```

These commands add rules to accept incoming traffic on HTTP and HTTPS ports only from Cloudflare's IP addresses.

### Conclusion

By following these steps, you enhance your NGINX server's security by allowing only Cloudflare to communicate with your server. This reduces the risk of direct attacks and leverages Cloudflare's performance and security benefits.
