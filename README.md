# Zaphkiel Workshop

Welcome to Zaphkiel Workshop, your personal space for rich and varied documentation on technology, web development, network administration, cybersecurity and much more. This site is built with Astro and the Starlight Starter Kit, offering a fluid and intuitive user experience.

## 🌟 About Zaphkiel Workshop

Zaphkiel Workshop is a space where I share tutorials, tips, and how-to guides in various areas of technology. From programming to system administration, this site is designed to document and share my knowledge and discoveries.

### Project Made with Starlight

Zaphkiel Workshop, crafted using the Starlight toolkit with Astro, is structured as follows:

```
.
├── public/
├── src/
│ ├── assets/
│ ├── content/
│ │ ├── docs/
│ │ └── config.ts
│ └── env.d.ts
├── astro.config.mjs
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

In Zaphkiel Workshop, `.md` and `.mdx` files located in `src/content/docs/` are crucial. Each file becomes a route accessible via its filename.

For visual content, add your images to `src/assets/` and embed them in Markdown using relative links.

Place static assets like favicons in the `public/` folder.

### Essential Commands

Execute these commands from the project's root directory in your terminal:

| Command           | Action                              |
